This repository contains both server and client files. The **Rust** server
handles:

- Authentication
- QR code (scanning, i.e. the link you're taken to, and generation)
- API
- HTTP requests

The client is **Typescript** code bundled into an index.js file which is sent
along with the web pages. This handles most of the mahjong interface, such as
tables and scoring.
