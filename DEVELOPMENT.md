This repository contains both server and client files. The **Rust** server handles:

- Authentication
- QR code (scanning, i.e. the link you're taken to, and generation)
- API
- HTTP requests

The client is **Typescript** code bundled into an index.js file which
is sent along with the web pages. This handles most of the mahjong
interface, such as tables and scoring.
